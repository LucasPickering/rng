### Vowel Randomization

Replace each vowel segment with a random segment of the same length

### Consonant DMPH Randomization

Replace each consonant segment with a random consonant segment that DMPH's to the same thing

### Synonyms

n-grams of size 3+ (e.g.) can be checked against a thesaurus, and if they match a real word, replaced with a synonym (or antonym).

This would have to be an extension on an existing method.
